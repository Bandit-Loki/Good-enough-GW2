This is a path for GW2TacO and Blish HUD through the Lowland Shore map for harvesting Honey Flowers and Lowland Pine Saplings. It does not cover every node on the map and I'm sure the path could be much more efficient but hopefully it can be a useful tool until the more complete paths are released

To use, just extract the zip file in
Blish HUD: Documents/Guild Wars 2/addons/blishhud/markers
TacO: the POIs folder inside your GW2TacO folder
